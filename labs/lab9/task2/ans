1. No, a file cannot infect itself because when you try to open it it does an error.
   I guess its because an executable cannot be edited while execution.
2. Another infection (virus code) is added at the end of the file (ELFexec2short).
3. The virus messages are printed twice, because of the doubled code.
4. After the 7th time posting the virus code, it won't run.
    virus is size of 566 bytes, after adding it code 6 times to original
    size of 660 its 4056, after adding the next one it will crash.

   6 - size of 0xFD8 (4056)
   7 - size of 0x120E (4622)
   virus code size - 0x236 (566)
   

ELFexec2short sizes -
0 - 0x294 (660)
1 - 0x4CA (1226)
2 - 0x700 (1792)
3 - 0x936
4 - 0xB6C
5 - 0xDA2 
6 - 0xFD8 
7 - 0x120E
